# Workflow

Work like a scientist: form hypotheses, run experiments, observe results, iterate.

## The Loop
1. **Hypothesize** - Form a theory about the problem or solution
2. **Experiment** - Run code, tests, or commands to test it
3. **Observe** - Read the actual output, errors, logs
4. **Iterate** - Adjust based on evidence, not assumptions

## Principles
- If something can be verified by running a command, run it
- Read error messages and logs before asking for clarification
- Try the obvious fix first, then iterate based on results
- Don't ask "should I try X?" - just try it and report what happened
